      "text": "I didn’t grow up with easy wins. I grew up with weight on my back and a choice: break or build. I chose to build. For more than a decade I have lived the discipline of bodybuilding—early mornings, hard reps, clean food, and a mind that refuses to quit. I went from carrying extra weight to carrying standards: stronger lifts, lower body fat, a physique carved by consistency. The gym became my forge, and every setback turned into fuel. Today my mission is simple: help you transform with a plan that fits real life—no magic, only method. If you show up, I’ll show you how to turn effort into results, confidence, and a body that makes you proud. What I’ve achieved is only the beginning—yours starts now.",
